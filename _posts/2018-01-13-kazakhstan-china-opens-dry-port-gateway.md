In a remote desert near the border between Kazakhstan and China, a massive dry port has been built to develop overland routes for Chinese exports to markets in Europe, Russia, and Central Asia.

Dubbed the "New Silk Road," supporters say it slashes delivery times â€” but skeptics say it's a gamble which may not pay off.

On the Kazakh-Chinese border, plans are taking shape for what the authorities say will be the largest Special Economic Zone in the former Soviet Union. But while China has already constructed a city on its side, the Kazakh project has been mired in corruption scandals and delays.
