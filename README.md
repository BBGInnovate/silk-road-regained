China is investing more than $1 trillion in roads, bridges, railways, ports, and power plants in more than 70 countries — a bold strategy to steer global commerce its way and reclaim its Silk Road heritage. This project examines how the 'Belt and Road Initiative' is transforming lives, reshaping landscapes and tilting the geopolitical balance.

[“The Dragon's Reach”](http://silkroadregained.com) aggregates reporting on China’s ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ from the [Broadcasting Board of Governors’](https://www.bbg.gov) five independent news agencies: Voice of America, Middle East Broadcast Networks, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and The Office of Cuba Broadcasting.
